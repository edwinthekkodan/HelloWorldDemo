Most prokaryotic cells, particularly the bacterial cells, have a chemically
complex cell envelope. The cell envelope consists of a tightly bound three
layered structure i.e., the outermost glycocalyx followed by the cell wall and
then the plasma membrane. Although each layer of the envelope performs
distinct function, they act together as a single protective unit. Bacteria can
be classified into two groups on the basis of the differences in the cell envelopes
and the manner in which they respond to the staining procedure developed
by Gram viz., those that take up the gram stain are Gram positive and the
others that do not are called Gram negative bacteria.
Glycocalyx differs in composition and thickness among different
bacteria. It could be a loose sheath called the slime layer in some, while
in others it may be thick and tough, called the capsule. The cell wall
determines the shape of the cell and provides a strong structural support
to prevent the bacterium from bursting or collapsing.
The plasma membrane is selectively permeable in nature and interacts
with the outside world. This membrane is similar structurally to that of
the eukaryotes.
A special membranous structure is the mesosome which is formed
by the extensions of plasma membrane into the cell. These extensions are
in the form of vesicles, tubules and lamellae. They help in cell wall
