An improved model of the structure of cell membrane was proposed
by Singer and Nicolson (1972) widely accepted as fluid mosaic model
(Figure 8.4). According to this, the quasi-fluid nature of lipid enables
lateral movement of proteins within the overall bilayer. This ability to move
within the membrane is measured as its fluidity.
The fluid nature of the membrane is also important from the point of
view of functions like cell growth, formation of intercellular junctions,
secretion, endocytosis, cell division etc.
One of the most important functions of the plasma membrane is the
transport of the molecules across it. The membrane is selectively permeable
to some molecules present on either side of it. Many molecules can move
briefly across the membrane without any requirement of energy and this
is called the passive transport. Neutral solutes may move across the
membrane by the process of simple diffusion along the concentration
gradient, i.e., from higher concentration to the lower. Water may also move
across this membrane from higher to lower concentration. Movement of
water by diffusion is called osmosis. As the polar molecules cannot pass
through the nonpolar lipid bilayer, they require a carrier protein of the
membrane to facilitate their transport across the membrane. A few ions
or molecules are transported across the membrane against their
concentration gradient, i.e., from lower to the higher concentration. Such
a transport is an energy dependent process, in which ATP is utilised and
is called active transport, e.g., Na+/K+ Pump.
