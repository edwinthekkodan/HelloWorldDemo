8.5.2 Cell Wall
As you may recall, a non-living rigid structure called the cell wall forms
an outer covering for the plasma membrane of fungi and plants. Cell wall
not only gives shape to the cell and protects the cell from mechanical
damage and infection, it also helps in cell-to-cell interaction and provides
barrier to undesirable macromolecules. Algae have cell wall, made of
cellulose, galactans, mannans and minerals like calcium carbonate, while
in other plants it consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and proteins.
The cell wall of a young plant cell, the primary wall is capable of growth,
which gradually diminishes as the cell matures and the secondary wall is
formed on the inner (towards membrane) side of the cell.
The middle lamella is a layer mainly of calcium pectate which holds
or glues the different neighbouring cells together. The cell wall and middle
lamellae may be traversed by plasmodesmata which connect the cytoplasm
of neighbouring cells.
